# [[Cascata Leontina]]

sheet:: [Fultimator](https://fultimator.com/character-sheet/A2ZilaCajai6HWufGUww)

A fierce and nimble Viera, known for her acrobatic combat style. She moves with the grace of a dancer, using flips, twirls, and sudden handstand kicks to disorient and disable foes. Scarred from past battles and wearing a signature eyepatch, her hardened expression and lean, muscular frame speak of years spent surviving deadly ruins. She's fast, unpredictable, and lethal in close quarters.

She is the sole survivor of a doomed expedition deep into ancient ruins. Her closest crewmates, trusted like family, never made it out. Haunted by guilt and unanswered questions, she hides her grief behind sharp eyes, a colder edge, and relentless focus â€”pushing her body to the limit as if trying to outrun the ghosts that follow her.

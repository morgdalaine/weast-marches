## Log

We meet Yugri who offers to create items with the metal.

Whisp asks Yugri about local gossip, and he tells her that someone stubbed their toe. Fantasia gets knife sharpened. Whisp tells Olivia how to take care of cats.

Cascata takes a shortcut and the party gets hit by a rockslide.

We reach the prison and Whisp uses a crowbar to open the door.

The door leads to a foyer filled with icicles. We spot air vents in the floor and walls, which are pumping frigid air.

We spot two prison doors on either side. Both doors seem to radiate some type of magic. The eastern one is a guard room with a desk, 4 podium pillars with statues behind them. The western one is a long corridor with 12 busts of different people of various races. Halfway down the hall is another set of bars which are radiating icy white magic. We hear chiseling down that way. Fantasia yells out 'Hello' and the chiseling stops momentarily but we don't hear any response.

Cascata picks the lock on the guard room door and opens the gate. The statues in the room seem to breathe out some kind of icy breath but we avoided anything dangerous.

We find a pair of brawling knuckles on the table.

There is a door to the south in the guard room with strange writing above the door that doesn't seem related to the Granite Ledger writing.

The south area looks like a general population area with a table and bones with shackles.

To the south of the general population area is a scary massive solitary confinement door that with glowing writing.

Fantasia says we shouldn't open the door, and a voice from that scary door replied 'please open the door.' Fantasia asked why they are imprisoned and the voice said 'existing'. The voice sounds like it is inside our heads and we can feel the vibrations.

Whisp says she wants to open the door, and takes a step inside the gen pop room. It's extremely cold in this room.

We head back to the foyer and Cascata picks the lock of the western door. The busts in the hallway have name plates and with a year to year inscription.

Cascata heads to the final door, and sees an old elderly elf woman carving into the wall. The writing is completely different and makes her relive her past grief.

Fantasia says "she must be bored", and the woman laughs and says "i havent been bored in a very long time".

Cascata asks "why are you in here?", she replied, "They deemed me witch and left me here to rot but I refuse."

Cascata tries to open the door, and isn't able to. Cascata asks how we can help her and the old lady says it isn't a good idea because the others would fear her. Cascata asks her what she means, and the old lady shows us strange visions of the future.

Whisp asks her name, and she replies 'Oryëo'. She asks if she wants to be free and she turns away.

Oryëo says, 'Sephiroth (referring to Whisp) the thing you seek is in the northwest past the plains. Now leave me.'

Cascata asks who the other person in the other room is. Whisp asks if they have an opinion about that entity. She says yes, but its not enough to change your conviction. Whatever choice you make is the right choice.

We head to the other room. Whisp asks the entity what their name is, it replies Ezereth, Keeper of the First Heat.

Fantasia asks if we will die if the door opens and it says no. Whisp asks it to make a vow, it refuses. Whisp asks if it wants to bargain. She offers freedom in exchange for peace, but when she includes the Granite Ledger it refuses. It says that it was bound by the Granite Ledger.

Cascata says we should talk to the Granite Ledger first. Cascata asks what its intention is if freed, and it says return home to the south. Cascata has a vision of it as a massive fire dragon and Cascata believes it wants to be left alone and has no ill will towards others. Ezereth says it has existed before the Cataclysm.

Whisp offers the bargain again, 1000 years of peace with an option to renew and it agrees.

We open the door and see a massive dragon chained to the walls. Fantasia and Whisp helps break the chains using Whisp's hum and Fantasia artificing skill. Whisp gets a magical bond of Trust with Ezereth. It remakes Whisp's shell and is able to inflict heavy fire damage.

Cascata asks what caused the Cataclysm. Ezereth says, 'That was us. Come find me in the south if you want to chat.'

Once free, Ezereth destroys the roof and flies away.

We return to Oryëo and she asks if we are happy now and Fantasia said she had mixed feeling. Fantasia then asks about the wise woman Seria the Silver. She replies that she seek the icelands in the south.

Whisp asks if Oryëo has changed her mind about freedom. Oryëo asks if the bargain will be the same. After some deliberation, it's decided that she will stay in the prison because the world can't handle her future sight. However, we agreed to send people to come with food and conversation. Before we live, Oryëo asks us to kill her son. She says he is no longer himself, and its time his reign came to an end. In the grasslands, he is calling himself the Burnt King. Cascata asks for his real name, and she says Trysta'an.

On the way back, Fantasia slips down and finds a skeleton holding a magic shield. Whisp takes the shield.

Olivia has set up a playpen for the cats.

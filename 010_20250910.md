## Log

### From Seven

Fantasia gives Edgar detailed directions so he can lead the party toward the Ashlands

We make our way through the swamp without issue, passing a castle that seems to be sliding into the muck. We can see shadowlands to the southeast, in the direction we're headed

At one point Edgar trips and comes face to face with a carved or clay face embedded in the ground. It looks familiar to him and he sketches it for his later reference. On closer inspection the face looks very similar to Wisp, as though they could be siblings. Wisp does not sense that there is any spirit animating the construct.

Cascata scouts around the area to see if there are other similar heads or other clues. She finds shards in the surrounding earth but doesn't come across other intact parts. 

Seven takes some time to ritually connect with the construct or what remains of it—it's worse for wear, nearly destroyed. Seven does not feel anything and Wisp confirms that it's an empty shell, either before or after it's been animated. We get the sense that it's been animated previously but now is broken. The group decides not to try to unearth the construct for now, though they mark it on the map for later reference.

The group continues on for a while, stepping into some high grasslands where it seems to be perpetual night. We can see civilisation in the distance, with chimneys billowing black smoke into the sky. Wisp feels trapped in place suddenly; she notices there is a metal hand coming out of the ground holding onto her leg. Other metal beings rise out of the ground with armor and weapons, accompanied by a small ooze. 

The group is able to fight them off, though not without expending some resources and taking some damage themselves. Wisp decides to keep the ooze in a terrarium and name it Mr. Squishy.

Following the fight, Fantasia puts together a magic tent to allow the group to rest. Wisp daydreams of the destroyed construct we found earlier in the day. Fantasia explores in her dreams. Edgar engages in some planning with Cascata. Edgar also makes a note in his notebook about how Seven behaved during the combat, having seen him draw energy out of one of the magitek troopers to heal himself.

While he is settling down, Seven sees and overhears some locals grumbling about having to work—they are hungry and irritable and overworked, unhappy with the status quo. They are human-elf half-breeds, sinewy and malformed and malnourished, covered in ash and soot, wearing rags and dragging weapons and mining equipment behind them. 

Edgar is able to talk the band of locals somewhat onto the side of the group, though they seem very subservient to the Unburnt King, with the help of other group members offering them encouragement and supplies. However they soon quickly depart for their second shift of the day. The group decides to start the gradual process of setting up an aid station to help the locals and hopefully gradually encourage them to break free of their servitude (this is a 10-step group clock). 

With some concerted group effort, we are able to establish a corral for mud deer, able to bring two of them into the corral and start the process of domesticating them to hopefully feed the locals. 2 sections of the clock filled.

We returned back to town, finding on arrival that one of the workers from the Ashlands had stowed away on our burro. His name is Moop and he seems very keen to emulate Seven. 

We all gain 7xp

### From Edgar

- Using directions We get from Fantasia—I lead the group as we head towards the shadowlands in the far west.
- I trip on a Metal face in the ground. I sketch the face….seems like someone I've seen before. It's Whisp's face. We excavate the form a bit from the ground, but decide once Seven sees that there is no magic in it, that we should leave it be.
- We reach the shadowlands…land of perpetual night. To the south we see an earthen stone tower with chimneys and signs of civilization. Walking through waist high grass.
- A long metal hand extends from the ground and grabs Whisp. Combat ensures against a group of 2 metal beings & an ooze. Seven throws Umbras around like candy, Fantasia's curse gets in her way, Whisp corporal cuddles the ooze, Cascata Dances and wacks the knights. I manage to weaken one of the metal beings.
- I note in my Tanagrest empire logs the draining the robot that Seven does. Seems sortof evil looking.
- We rest in a magic tent near a town with a tower and castle. Camp Actions abound. Seven (Through his quirk) learns that the local mad max style waifs are complaining about being hungry.  Zelots—Hungry and Overworked.
- I use pictures of the Tanagrest empire and a speech to try and get these Zelots on our side against the unburnt king. They are pooooooor.
- DC10 - 10 Step Clock—Aid station for the Waifs—Waif station.
- **Actions taken:** Domesticate the Mud Deer / Food acquisition (Build a Corral / get the deer in them. Seven Leads)  Filled 2 sections. 2/10

A painter who works as a landscape painter for the imperials. He arrived to the town in the new world as part of a campaign to draw inspiring landscapes to send back to the Tangrest regime for use as settler propaganda. For examples of work see - Albert Bierstad, Thomas Cole. As he has traveled with the military painting scenes he has slowly become disillusioned with the Tangrest Empire.

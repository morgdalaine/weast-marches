We started out from town to head toward the mountains. The beginning of the journey was rough. In the distance there is a narrow pass created by erosion. As we approach the path, we see scatterings of what seems to be makeshift umbrellas and bones and other unpleasant artifacts. 

Cascata goes closer to investigate and when assembling the umbrellas/parasols together finds that the paint on them resembles a pair of eyes. Some of them have massive amounts of blood and scratches on them. Most of the bones are definitely humanoid in size/shape (a bit longer than ours), some have been gnawed on. We also found a number of lost sandals and dried blood throughout the path. 

Cascata spends a fabula point to find an intact umbrella and take it with her as we continue through the narrow pass. We get the distinct impression that we're being watched but don't immediately see anything or anyone and are able to pass through without issues, emerging out onto an overlook in the middle of the mountain range. We can see the town and that the mountain range goes up a lot higher. The mountain range hugs the coastline.

If we were going to return home by an alternate path it would be doable but would involve going higher into the mountains to loop back around.

To the south and further west is the coastline. We can hear what sounds like someone blowing on a bottle on the cliff face below us every time the wind blows—we decide to go investigate the source of the sound. About 50 feet down from the cliffside and about 500-600 feet above the water is an inlaid set of doors. 

We make our way down the cliff face and go knock on the doors; no one answers. The doors look quite heavily fortified and have the appearance of a prison door. There are arrow slits on either side of the door. Fantasia tries to call out through the arrow slits to ask if anyone's there and if they want to trade. There is an echo but no response. It is very cold inside and Fantasia can see ice inside the chamber coating the pillars.

We decide to move on for now and see if we can find some intelligent life that can tell us about this chamber. As we move on, Cascata finds a cave; we can smell something cooking on a fire and can see a flickering light coming from deep inside as snow starts to fall on this mountain. We enter the cave to investigate further. It doesn't appear to be a natural cave (parts of it are hewn, perfectly rectangular entrance ways etc.) and there are rudimentary cave paintings on the walls. 

In the cave we find a tall, built man with pointy ears and fanged teeth, wearing the sandals we recognise from the narrow pass earlier. He is wearing a fur cap and a puffy vest and is tending to a fire. He invites us to sit with him at his fire, seemingly pleased to see people after not seeing anyone for quite a while. He doesn't recall exactly how long he's been out there but has a few days of rations left and is willing to share some of his frozen meat with us. He takes out a little notepad and makes notes of our names. He says he has a bunch of different names; most people just call him "friend" but we can call him whatever he wants. His hand is cold, it's like shaking hands with stone. 

Fantasia asks him if he's a devil because of his hesitance to give out his real name; he laughs and says no.

Cascata explains a bit about the group's history and their purpose in the area and where the town is if our new friend would like to visit. She asks him if there are any other people he knows or friendly folk in the area. He hasn't had a chance to talk to anyone in a while; he is a bit lonely as people who come to visit leave too soon. He invites us to sit with him and trade as his people are a trading people.

We show him the umbrella we found and he looks quite grim. He takes the umbrella with both hands and asks if there were more of us before we had to use this. Cascata explains that we found it on the ground among a bunch of other items and bones, and that we haven't had to use it. He breathes a huge big sigh, seemingly relieved. He explains that the umbrellas were made by his people (including his wife) and used to scare creatures off. He says the creatures are terrifying; they are gliding beasts that haunt the canyons, moving with a feline grace, hopping from cliff to cliff on membranes of skin between their limbs. They have a horrible bite and nasty claws in the front.

Fantasia asks if there's anything in the lowlands that would be valuable to his people. Friend suggests that there's a reed that grows in the swamps that provides a healing salve, it prevents infections and would be very useful. We have seen this reed before. Cascata says we can definitely bring some of the reed with us next time we come visit.

Cascata asks friend about the big metal door we saw. Friend confirms it's a prison. 

As the conversation continues, Whisp notices that it's dead of night outside, though it only feels like we've been here for a little while. Cascata and Seven don't look great to Whisp; they don't seem to notice it but Whisp can see their breath. Fantasia looks fine. Everyone seems a lot skinnier than Whisp remembers. Whisp starts trying to carry/drag people out of the cave though Friend tries to prevent us from leaving, encouraging us to stay the night and warning of dangers outside. There's a brief moment where Whisp is quite afraid of him as she reaches the mouth of the cave—he looks taller than we remember him and starts looking quite intimidating. He says, "I wish you hadn't done that" and turns around and walks back very silently into the cave.

We feel very tired on exiting the cave and feel like we haven't eaten in a while. Recognising how late it is we start looking for an alternative cave to spend the night in. It takes us a long time to find a suitable cave but are finally able to find one (after incurring the Weak status effect). Whisp promises to watch while everyone sleeps. Everyone who sleeps has awful nightmares and wakes up very cold. 

Once we are awake and more or less alert, we drink some tonics to recover somewhat from the previous night and head further into the mountains. We find ourselves caught in an avalanche and everyone takes 10 minor damage as we have to unbury ourselves out of the snow, but are nearing the highest peak as we clear ourselves out. 

To the southwest, about two more days' worth of marching away, we can see a castle floating in the sky, just above the coast. We can also see a small settlement of what looks like nomadic shelters down the mountainside further west toward the interior, about a two hour walk away. We decide to head toward the small settlement, which is populated with tall, built, pointy-eared and fanged individuals wearing similar sandals to those we found in the narrow pass earlier. 

Whisp goes over and greets them and a tall woman raises her hand and greets us in return. They look exactly like the person we met in the cave but their voices sound completely different. There are a bunch of children running around playing tag and then get excited when they see newcomers, starting to root through Cascata's stuff and pulling at her belt, asking what all her items are. The older woman shoos the children away then tells the group they are leaving but asks what she can do for us. Cascata explains the situation and asks if it would be possible to trade and learn a bit more about the surroundings. The older woman seems very happy to trade and beckons us to follow her.

Cascata asks if they are the stonewalkers and the woman laughs; she can tell we've been to the swamps. Her name is Freti and she brings us to introduce her to their quartermaster, Muna, for trade if we want. Her grandfather set up the Granite Ledger and they use that name to trade with people and do business. Cascata explains where our village is and where we can be found, advises we will try and make regular treks back and forth to maintain a relationship.

Fantasia asks about the bodies in the pass and whether it is dangerous. Freti advises that they've used that pass for many years and that it's important everyone stays together when travelling through there, but terrible things live there so they take the long way round now. Cascata shows her the umbrella and Freti looks shocked and upset; her grandmother made it. Cascata tries to return her the umbrella but Muna tells us to keep it as we'll need it for protection. 

Cascata asks Muna about the person we met in the cave—Freti calls him the merchant and asks how long we were with him. Whisp says we were there for an afternoon and part of an evening but Freti says it was actually days. She explains that the metal ore in the mountains is greedy and sometimes doesn't let even spirits pass on. Whisp remembers that we found a cabin that was made of the same metal to the west of here. Freti says they have used the metal to build with as well as to make armour and weapons. She calls it wolfram.

Freti says her people also trade with others to the north and further west. There are many peoples about this land. Her people try to stay out of the Grass Seas. Fantasia asks about the castle and if anyone lives there. It's said that many people have lived there; there used to be a dragon there. Millennia ago, they captured the dragon and imprisoned him inside the mountain. 

Freti points us toward an older man, Muna, who can help us with trading. He is loading boxes onto a beast of burden. He offers us a young burro and says they trade in gold. He inspects our zenit and finds them pleasing, says we can have the burro for 100 zenit. We exchange the coins for the burro and look at the rest of his wares. 

Fantasia is interested in buying or trading for tools if possible; Cascata is interested in accessories (headbands, rings, etc.). 

Muna gives Fantasia a bag of beans that can either be cooked and eaten or planted to grow more beans. 

Cascata asks Muna if he can tell us about any noteworthy places or any places to avoid. He tells us to steer clear of the Sea of Grass (talking about the Shadowlands, the White Monolith, etc.)—they're "not good people." They don't trade there anymore; he's reluctant to share the story with us but explains that the people there have changed and soured. They used to be a prosperous, peace-loving people; the last time the Granite Ledger were there they crucified three of their friends and began chanting. This was about a decade ago. Cascata suggests that they could check it out and let the Granite Ledger know if anything's changed.

Whisp asks Muna if he's come across a hole or a portal that leads to another world in his travels because she's trying to find her way back to where she came from, in a different plane, and thinks the place she's looking for is somewhere on this continent. He says that "things" like Whisp used to walk the Shadowlands and hopes that's of some assistance, but he's never seen a portal before. He says there's a hole in the ground in the dry area where nothing grows but it's a chasm, not a portal.

The Granite Ledger all gather in the centre of what was their settlement to move on together. Freti offers to let us travel with them for a while if we're heading northeast as well—they're going the long way so it would take us days to get home if we follow. We agree to go with them for safety in numbers and to accompany people familiar with the terrain. Traveling with them is quite pleasant and we are relatively unbothered by creatures. We stop for a while near a beautiful waterfall for everyone to gather water; the children swim for a while in the pool and we spend the night there. 

There's a cave there where the Granite Ledger used to mine wolfram but they had to stop because of beasts that overran the cave. One of them, Goya, tells us that his family mined there for generations and he took his first steps there; they would like to be able to mine there again if possible. He explains that, now that they can see the sun again, both good and bad happenings have accelerated—but they would make it worth our time if we could make the mine safe again.

We continue on again in the morning, heading to the north, skirting the edge of the mountains. We can see where we think the town approximately is from here. There are large coniferous trees in this area, and as everyone's walking together through the woods, we can see large beautiful wolves following us/stalking us through the forest but don't attack due to the large numbers. We camp in the woods and the Granite Ledger takes care of the watch. 

As we exit the treeline the following morning, we can see the coast up ahead; probably about one more day's travel to get back to town. Built into the mountainside there is what looks like a mill. It's seen better days but everyone circles the wagons and some of the Granite Ledger are able to get the mill working to grind some things—it takes a good amount of time and about 5+ of them to get it working before they continue on.

With the town finally in sight, we stop in a beautiful meadow full of gorgeous flowers. Some of the children take the petals and make tea that stains their teeth different colours. One of the children brings us a little bag of the flower petals. The Granite Ledger doesn't come near the town but they stop and watch us walk towards the town for a little bit before moving on again—they are headed toward the swamp.

### From [[Fantasia the Dreamer]]

Head South and encounter tattered umbrellas and bones in an ominous canyon. We acquired one of the umbrellas, working our way through the canyon with its various signs of battle. We dubbed it the Blood Canyon.

We heard a distant whistling sound and followed it to the side of a cliff inlaid with elaborate doors. As we approached it appeared to be a prison door of some sort. We dubbed it the Icebox.

We marked it on our map and continued on when we caught a whiff of delicious food emanating from cave. We entered, seeking its source. There we met a nameless Friend who bid us to stay and eat. It turned out it was draining the life from us and we were saved by Whisp's perception.

After a nap and an avalanche, we made it to the summit where we spied a massive floating castle. We also spied a group of nomads down the other side of the mountain.

We head down and meet the nomads. We are introduced to Freedi who leads the caravan and Moona the quartermaster who apparently trade. They referred to themselves as the granite ledger. We found the metal of the mountain was known as Wolfram, which they used to make tools and items.

We traveled with the nomads on our way back. We stopped at an icy waterfall with a Wolfram Mine full of beasts we might want to clear out. Next we reached a forest of coniferous trees full of wolves with coats of made of moonlight. Then when we reached the grassland again we found an old Mill. Lastly, we encounter a beautiful meadow in the grasslands with flowers for tea.

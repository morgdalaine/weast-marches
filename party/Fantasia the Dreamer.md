# [[Fantasia the Dreamer]]

sheet:: [Fultimator](https://fultimator.com/character-sheet/MFUTXjyzFZDbNzTG6uV6)

Fantasia deals in dreams and dream stuff, exchanging the bad for good, or drawing forth pieces from the Dreamscape for a time. Though quite frightening to some, it can often prove an invaluable service in enchanted lands where the magics present can cause all sorts of dream disorders. Though, it's also hard be frightened of someone that sleeps as much as Fantasia does, since she is equally likely to have narcoleptic fit in the midst of conversation or battle.

As a mischevous child, Fantasia insulted an old man's baldness and was prompty cursed with the Morphean Veil. She slept for a year and a day, until awoken by Gloria the Golden, who taught her to channel the curse. Unfortuneately the only one the wise woman knew that could break the curse was Seria the Silver, a wise woman who knew the truth of the dreams and the moon. Now, as an adult, she has come to the Old Lands on word that the wise woman might be found here, but the [[Cult of Morpheus]], who originally cursed her, has come following the same rumors.

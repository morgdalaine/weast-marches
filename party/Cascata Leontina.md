# [[Cascata Leontina]]

sheet:: [Fultimator](https://fultimator.com/character-sheet/A2ZilaCajai6HWufGUww)

A fierce and nimble Viera treasure hunter, known for her acrobatic agility and capoeira-inspired combat style. She moves with the grace of a dancer and the precision of a killer, using flips, twirls, and sudden handstand kicks to disorient and disable foes. Scarred from past battles and wearing a signature eyepatch, her hardened expression and lean, muscular frame speak of years spent surviving deadly ruins, outwitting rivals, and navigating the shadows of the underworld in pursuit of rare artifacts. She's fast, unpredictable, and lethal in close quarters.

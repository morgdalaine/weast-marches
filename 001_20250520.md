## Log

Town is built out of the ships that have brought us here. It has a wall made of ship's hull. The ground is terrible to sleep on due to the swamp nearby. In the distance are shadowy lands of some sort.

Everyone on the expedition has a customized waterproof field notebook of some sort. We decided to look to start gathering firewood for winter so we headed towards the swamp.

We found a copse of trees near a pool with a bird. In the center we harvested a few reeds with a soothing property. In the reeds we found the remains of a cloak made from plant materials.

Next we approached the bird, which seemed potentially aggressive. To soothe it, we acquired a fish from the pond. Upon approach we realized the bird is 20 ft tall with an anchor sticking out of its back and can talk. We soothed him with the fish, then promised him another fish we did not have to answer our questions. We learned there was a community of "plant ghosts" to the north of the copse from the bird.

It did not like that we didn't have the second fish. In desperation we began gathering fish. We pulled canned sardines from our stores and fed them to the giant heron until it was satisfied.

Next we headed north to the "Plant Ghosts" where we spied one of the ghostly beings disappear into a tree when we tried to talk to it. In an attempt to detect the creatures, we discovered a terrible sinister energy dwells deep beneath the swamp, spreading its length.

A compelling introduction later, and some of them come out to greet us with "You shouldn't be here." We traded shinies and were told this was someone else's home, a god with "She" pronouns with a nature noise for a name. We were told some of them were more militant than others.

We are allowed to trade, but not overstay our welcome.

We learned of the Stonewalkers from the mountain who are "Nice". If we encounter others who look "not quite right" we should run. Further North is the sea. There are a lot more of the giant herons.

We decide to me "Her" and climb into our own graves to dream of her.

We went to the dream realm and got "spoken to" by an eldritch god. Seven embellishes the dream and then anointed with mud. Mulch is given a sacred stick.

We found a hut with a large skeleton, a slimy jacket and business card. We also found an empty trade pack. Maybe a Stonewalker?

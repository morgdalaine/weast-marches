# [[Tanagrest Empire]]

The Tanagrest Empire's unwavering dominion stands firm, even as its golden age fades into memory. From the monolithic halls of **CAPITOL**, the bureaucracy governs with relentless precision, its vast machine of order no longer expanding but refusing to crumble. Though the legions no longer march beyond the borders, and ambition has given way to inertia, the empire enduresâ€”stagnant yet unyielding, a marble edifice against the shifting tides of time.

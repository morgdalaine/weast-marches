# [[Seven]]

sheet:: [Fultimator](https://fultimator.com/pc-gallery/v6Zq3xHW03yRWiHOkoas)

A changeling raised by humans in the Tanagech Empire, Seven easily fell in with outcasts and strangers, and grew drawn to clandestine groups meeting in secret under the Empire's watchful eye - labour activists and later more radical elements. He was arrested and jailed when identified as the initiator/organiser of a labour strike; another member of the budding labour/protest movement smuggled him out of prison under cover of darkness, leaving Seven little choice but to flee the Imperial authorities. He has ventured into the West Marches only more certain of his ideals, and seeking to make wider contacts and build solidarity toward anti-imperial revolution from the outside.

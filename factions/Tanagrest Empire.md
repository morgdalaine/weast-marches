# [[Tanagrest Empire]]

The Tanagrest Empire's unwavering dominion stands firm, even as its golden age fades into memory. From the monolithic halls of **CAPITOL**, the bureaucracy governs with relentless precision, its vast machine of order no longer expanding but refusing to crumble. Though the legions no longer march beyond the borders, and ambition has given way to inertia, the empire enduresâ€”stagnant yet unyielding, a marble edifice against the shifting tides of time.

## Commandments

- **Eternal Emperor / Obedience Above All.** Defy no command of the Emperor, for his word is law and his law is life. Loyalty to the Emperor is loyalty to Tanagrest. Lay down your life for Tanagrest endures beyond all flesh.
- **Memory is Duty / Death Does Not Excuse.** Preserve the record of victories and treacheries alike; let no lesson of the past be lost. The dishonored dead shall not rest; their names are stricken from memory until debts are paid.
- **Craft is Service / Labor for Tanagrest.** All labor, whether of forge, field, or ink, is holy if it strengthens Tanagrest. Let no craft be idle; in labor the Empire grows eternal. Strength exercised in service to Tanagrest, not in rebellion nor vanity.

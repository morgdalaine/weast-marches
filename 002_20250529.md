## Log

We travelled West to see what we could see. Spotted a ruined outpost in the distance nearer to the mountains. We successfully made it to the outpost before dark. It looks old and abandoned.

Entering the outpost made our ears pop. The place was indeed abandoned and stripped down. It looks pretty sturdy and defensible northward down the mountain. The cabin seems to be pressurized, possibly resulting from the solid block of strange metal beneath the floorboards.

We rested the night, formed some bonds and then set out the next day. Spying our surroundings we saw great white monoliths to the West in the Shadowlands. We traveled into the Shadowlands and saw six legged deer in the distance that seemed to be native to the area we dubbed Sixers.

Draw towards the monoliths, we placed our hands on it and discerned it was likely made with magic and found it was constructed without hard angles. Suddenly, three Ash Warriors appeared from one of the monoliths.

Ash Warriors
- normal damage from Physical
- normal damage from Air
- 1/2 damage from Ice

Victory!

We enter the building and find cremation ash floating in the wind. The Cremation Mausoleum. It starts with a hallway. The first room has a statue with strong wine dripping from supplicant hands. It also contains a painting of a woman with a hammer.

The second has a loom and a painting of a man with his dog. Opening the painting causes the ashes to gather in the small room into the form of the man and dog from the painting. The loom contains half-finished gloves, which we finish.

The third room holds the painting of a woman with a pointy black hat, fancy black dress and two arcane lanterns. The room also contains a forge with a half-finished axe, whcih we finish.

On the way back we encounter three people cruicifed on a large X. One of them had a melted crown and a ring. We then encountered the remnants of a fight between the Ash Warriors and some large pointy eared folk.

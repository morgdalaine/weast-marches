## Log

### From Vesper

Headed to the grasslands out west

Cascata has an umbrella hat

Edie leads us to a mucky bog. Uses their horse and lackeys with some wood to create a pulled boat. It takes all day to cross.

Vesper trains Airedrinn and Elderwynn. Elderwyn daydreams.

Next day, it's still twilight with eclipse. Shadow on grasslands.

Pass by weird white monoliths, Cascata shows entrance to the crypt

Paths to northwest (large, dead, white tree) and southwest (sulfur). We decide to head to the northwest to investigate the tree.

We pass through the ruins of a town. See small white monoliths with tops scorched off.

Decide to investigate the town. Go into craftsman house and find book on a desk. Find evil book.

Keep searching. House with leather ball, weird paintings… Vesper takes the ball

See weird trench carved into ground at entrance to town

Leave town and encounter tree with weird nest in it and a stone marker. The marker aligns with the eclipse. It has Thai-script language; Fantasia takes a rubbing.

We wait for birds to arrive; weird white birds with 2 sets of wings descend on tree.

Edie catches a bird and puts it in a birdcage.

Elves emerge from mounds

We poison them with sugar and other modern food

They build gallows overnight

Now we're being judged which means they set us on fire. We don't consent to that so we start blasting. We kill priest and his henchmen and recover his arcane staff.

The Burned King's birthday is coming up. Our burning was supposed to be a gift to him.

Recovered a note that says the king's men are collecting birds for his birthday present.

On the way home, Fantasia discovers a pirate pit and steals a gun. What a strange girl.

Edie leads us to a field of glowing flowers; we all gain Shaken status effect.

Vesper leads us to sunlight and we get home safely.

### Edie Notes: A True Believer Would Not Have Been Barbequed Like This

Oops I messed up our travel…we ended up stuck in a bog on our way to the grassland. I had tantara tow us out.

We finally arrive at the grasslands. We rest, since it was a hard time getting here.

My bodyguards grilled up dinner.
 When we woke up, it was still twilight?? There are unsettling shadows.

We are headed to the crypt? No, it's too dangerous.

We are just traveling West trying to find stuff within our capability.

Southwest smells like sulfur and industry, northwest has a large dead white tree, rather like a world tree.

We pass through the ruins of a town. There are white monoliths with scorch marks on the tops. There are are shadows indelibly marked on the ground like from an atomic bomb. There are linens still blowing.

We survey the town slowly, giving an opportunity for anyone who lives here to come out and say hi.

In a circular building, there was an acrid chemical smell, a writer's desk carved with alchemical symbols a la FMA. There is a black book on the desk, half-open—it is a derelict tinkerer's hovel.

I take it! It has a big skull on the cover and diagrams of death—think a flayed vitruvian man. It's a treatise on how far the human body can be pushed.

Elderwyn equips the book but keeps that intel to herself.

Suspicious house on far western edge of town.

I go into a room and it feels like stepping into antiquity. Baby mobiles hanging from windowsills, a broken-down crib, a volleyball-szied ball in the corner, made out of a sort of leather with thick stitches. There are paintings on the wall of people playing a ball game.

We did see some skellies. They look like hecked up elves a la Gollum as a hobbit. Bones are normal sized for elves, but the muscle attachment points are consistently incorrect.

The bones look less than a generation old.

We went to the big tree. There is a nest like a big sociable weaer nest; lots of holes.

There is a stonehenge sort of deal. We also find a carved bas relief stone slab, white stone, overgrown with grasses and lichen and moss. The stele is perfectly in line with the eclipse that is happening. There is writing; looks like thai language. We'd need to get a rosetta stone or something to help us translate. It's not the same language as the granite ledger, and different than what the old elf lady was carving. It is the same language that is in the book Elderwyn found. We compare the book to the stone and there are similar phrases and such but we can't really translate. One is a magic book and another seems like a religious ritual text.

I'd like to stay and see the birds return to the nest. As we wait, we feel watched, but not by birds. We triangulate the feeling to where the city is. Every once in a while we are sure the grass is moving. A bodyguard comes up and says we should make camp. About that time, we hear the flapping of wings, and we see a murmuration of stark white birds with two sets of wings offset from one another; they descend on the tree like locusts. Parasite hawks; a bunch look at me, tilted head, more flit down next to me, i am surrounded by birds. I would like a bird. I catch a bird!!! Serrated beak rending my jacket.

Meanwhile, there is disconcerting large movement in the grass behind us.

Four mounds rise up after Airdreann calls them out. they are ash white elves but wrong. bloodboys? gilly suits, axes, swords with black glass blades. They speak nice language gruffly. it is mutually intelligible with regular elvish! Cave elvish! They're saying, "You don't belong here. This is a holy place. Get the fuck before we make you."

I ask if we can say we are travelers who don't mean harm and can we go with them. The oldest one raises his arm; a bird lands, his blood is a thick sludge where it pierces him. "Buckle up, pals!", I say to my bodyguards. I am a bit blithe about it.

We all follow them together. They're like, "Good luck, that one's yours now," about the bird I caught.

There were more in the grass!!!! At least eight. Looks like a hunting party. There were a few with bows, but there are fucked up rabbits and a mud deer.

I ask themselves if have a name for themselves. It's somewhere between "The People" and "The Burnt". The Unburnt People.

@Elderwyn, "Better not show them that book." Elderwyn hides it under a sweater in her bag.

They say we stop here on the way and begin making a really simple camp. They have pemmican.

When Airdreann offers to make a fire, they hold their hand at the wood and the wood ignites. There's a weekened warrior joke at our expense lol.

Airdreann comments to my bodyguards that we will need to have a watch rotation tonight. I spend an inventory point to give them junk food. There's a moment of camaraderie, but then I realize two of them have pulled back prairie sod and are erecting a 10-foot white wood things. We worry that they are gallows. Are they?

A ninth person arrives wearing vestments. They are covered in white ash and have black lines over their skin and are wearing a tabard and shorts. Their skin has been branded. They say, "You are being judged. If you are to stand in front of the king you must be judged and be found worthy." The burnt are the followers of the burnt king.

We were asked to kill the burnt king! Yikes! What a pickle! He's apparently someone we know's son, but he's gone crazy.

Group huddle—Cascata says we choose violence! We are going to be killed lol.

"Hey, am I in danger?"

The priest says, "If you're chosen you're in no danger," but LOL it's obvious that we're about to be burnt. "If you survive this, like we all have, you can meet the king." They all kneel at the mention of the king; perfect timing to start to shoot them!!

Let's do a combat!!

Normal hunter dudes are resistant to fire and ice. Airdreann absolutely walloped them from the get-go. He one-shotted the sniper.

"Well, Xerxes obviously wasn't worried enough! Perhaps my Lord has favored me this day. I didn't want to buy him a birthday present, anyway." Priest is Vegeta…he attributes the guy dying to his being insufficienly faithful. Gross!

Fantasia deals quite a bit of damage ot the priest.

I shoot the priest, too! Take that, idiot! He looks down, at his chest, and at his sludgy ashy blood, falls to his knees, the blood on his body boils away, the wound closes, and he smiles at me. He died and is back up!!!! Scary!!!

We end up winning handily!

Fantasia leads the way back to the town. We come across what looks like a death pit. All manner of peoples' skellies are in this pit. We an tell there's an animal den or something? Fantasia blithely goes down, finds a cool gun.

I sort of flub navigating us home lol. We come across glow-in-the-dark flowers that makes our eyes itch and skin hurt. Walking through them gives us the shaken status effect.

Vesper leads us home.

- 5 XP, + 3 XP for fabula points spent. Full health, HP, MP, IP.

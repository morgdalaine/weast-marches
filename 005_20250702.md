## Log

### From [[Vesper]]

- Wisp joins after traveling through the mountains and overcoming a rockslide with the swamp flute
- Then we have a rest/camp scene
- Elderwyn and Vesper bond as Vesper coaches the bear elementalist through blitzball drills, making her ready for upcoming combat (Combat Lesson). During this training, Vesper sharpens her skills (Martial Practice).
- Elderwyn returns the favor and teaches Vesper Ignis (Magic Lesson).
- Cascata spends downtime dancing.
- Airedrinn trains with the derringer he found (Martial Practice).
- After the rest, we head out again and enter the tiny room (6) from (5). Cascata knocks on the heavy metal door and skittering can be heard from the other side. It's a storage room. Looks like some equipment for the Granite Ledger. There is a freestanding 10-foot pole in the corner. Under the pole is a white woolly scarf in the corner; Cascata feeds it food. She tries to pet it and it bites her. Now we have a mascot named Mittens. We also have a 10-Foot Pole.
- Mittens agrees to follow us and asks if it still rains blood outside. Weird.
- We enter room 7. There is a broken mineshaft in the middle of the room. It has been blocked off; the room smells of explosives. Then we hear a screech from far below. We drop a fire down the shaft and it burns spider webs; more screeching.
- Connect spiderwebs in the mineshaft to pictures of spiders we saw in logbook previously.
- Room 8 causes Vertigo for Airedrinn and then Vesper. Cascata tries to enter with eyes closed and tumbles.
- Elderwynn uses her rocky soul to try to understand why the Wolfram making us feel this way. "Greedy" (doesn't want to give anything up) metal that plays with gravity and sound, traps souls. Not much of it on new continent.
- Cascata pushes ahead and opens door. Minecart path goes straight to 10. The path to 9 is partially collapsed with the flicker of a lantern.
- Room 10 has huge deposits of wolfram the size of cars. Minecart track stops here. Airedrinn looks behind the deposits and sees thick spiderwebs. Vesper looks in the mining cart and finds miner foots and bones. Cascata clears the boots and gives them to Vesper. Vesper starts loading the cart with Wolfram.
- Cascata investigates the doors. South door has huge padlock; west door has magic wards sealing it.
- Elderwynn burns the webs which causes chittering and reveals a small hole to room 11. Party prepares for combat.
- Cascata picks the lock to the south. So many spider webs and then see the huge spider trying to put out the fire.
- Spider can climbs the webs and is "dangling" (flying) plus use lightning. It's a tough fight. Wisp is a standout with their protection ability.
- Discover tonberry (level 20 elite) in mine with cool cloak; need to return and defeat to get that shiny!
- We decide to take Mittens and summon the Granite Ledger to discuss providing wolfram and not mining until tonberry eliminated. Muna and Goya arrive. After explaining the mine is still inhabited by a monster and theorizing the wolfram makes big, powerful monsters from small creatures, we negotiate a permanent Granite Ledger trading outpost in Town.
- Camp.
- On way home, find bloody canyon walls and miserable creature (gliding beast). Cascata and Wisp warn us about it. Airedrinn fires his new gun at it. Discover resistant to Air and Ice. Named: cliff stalker. Airedrinn killed it and Wisp saved its babies. We are not terrible people.
- Returned to Town and met by Cid. Very angry about the baby cliff stalkers. Offer him specimens of spider in lieu of Airedrinn's gun. Give him theory about growing by wolfram. Convince him to study cliff stalkers.

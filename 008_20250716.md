## Log

Banx - Stonewalker selling woven ponchos.

Head down the coast to Icelands.

First day is smooth travel. The second is not! We are stalked by monsters from a sea vampire bats and a cat. Vampire bats are vulnerable to air.

On the third day the beach levels up and we enter a region of trees and rocks, dubbed the Rocky Forest. On the fourth day we come across a small skiff with black sails run aground. We check out the crates on board and find the ships journal. We ascertain it was probably a pirate or smuggler ship. We continue on and find Castle Bay where the floating castle hangs above the water.

On the fifth day we encounter our first ice field with a flowing river carrying ice chunks. We run a line across it to make passage easy. Finally we reach the icelands.

A large tower is two days travel south and a galleon is out in the bay. As we travel towards the tower, we encounter a tree monster and faeries, including a faerie princess. We entreat with them cordially, and are given an acorn. On the second day we lose some of our stuff in a crevasse to a hungry beast. Finally we arrive at the Blue Tower.

We knock at the door and see a second figure appears with bloodshot eyes. This one does not talk much, but another one shows up that does wearing a veil and carrying a staff. We bluff being the ward inspectors. The leader of the group is Punion, bloodshot mage. We defeat them with dance moves and the help of our new companion Ophua, The Cool Guy. Who also happens to be the tower owner's boyfriend.

It turns out the tower's owner is Seria the Silver. To break Fantasia's curse we need: Distilled Blood of Life. Which apparently requires killing a lot of elves. We decide to seek alternative means.

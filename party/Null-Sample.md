## Her Majesty's Imperial Demon

Technological and arcane advances allowed Imperialists to bind demons to themselves in exchange for another's soul. Forced to serve the Empire, Null committed atrocious acts. She was a weapon, leashed by blood-bound chains, her very essence twisted to obey.

During the Battle of ██, her Bound was killed, leaving her free but stranded—an unmoored fiend in enemy territory. The empire had no use for a rogue asset, and the rebellion had every reason to put her down. Yet, as she reeled from the sudden void in her being, something new took its place: choice.

It was then that ██, a rebel belonging to The One Link, found her. Rather than strike her down, they extended an offer: fight with them, not as a tool, but as something more. A gamble, not out of mercy, but to see if a weapon could truly change.

Is a demon without chains still a monster, or could she be something else?

## Bonds

- [[Yura Tanith Galleria]] **Inferiority**—she's scary but she said she'd protect me.
- [[Autumnal Onyx]] **Loyalty**—shared a "feast" and she made a golden chalice for me to drink wine from.

## Log

Roll up in the port town!

Off the boat:

Vesper, a human spiritist and sharpshooter. She/her.

Edie Deventer, an elf Loremaster/Wayfarer/Pilot, has her big feathered critter Mabel and her bodyguards Pieter and Marnix Snippe. Edie is well dressed and has a rather lot of luggage bags. She/her. Studied biology at the big university in the capital.

Airdreann, a grizzly-bear person sorcerer. He/him. Also from the alpine woods of northern Tanagrest.

Elderwyn, a tall black-bear-person elementalist, dressed partly for vacation and partly for the library, and with a big heavy bag of books. From the alpine woods of northern Tanagrest. The port smells salty/fishy/salty/briny/positive. Studies geology at the big university in the capital.

We met Cascata, bunny person dancer/weaponmaster/rogue. She/her. In her 30's, fit, no-nonsense, scarred up face.

Bonds:
Options: Admiration, inferiority, loyalty, mistrust, affection, hatred

Airdreann —> Elderwyn; they are childhood friends

Elderwyn —> Admiration towards Airdreann; they are childhood friends

Edie—>Mistrust toward Elderwyn; I'm a bit self-centered and so think she might have come along to spy on my research.

Last time: Folks went to the mines, discovered the people living there. Merchants who travel across the mountain passes.

- We go walking through a sea of grass. Edie is riding her big critter. We hear bleating?? Animal sounds, maybe in pain? A bit off the path, coming from the same spot. Six-legged deer looking things, intertwined, hard to see where one starts and stops. Oh lol they're mating??? Melding?? They finish and slop onto the ground, and there is a churning of earth as they return to the earth, and it was like they were never there at all. There's a big one further away. People currently call them sixers. I'd call them mud deer, myself!
- We arrive at the cave, there is a beautiful waterfall. Huge cavern, looks equal parts rough-hewn into the mountain but also naturally formed. Elderwyn is interested the rocks. She is able to see that it is man-made and has the beginnings of a mine. Partially collapsed, maybe a generation of disrepair.
- There is a big rock with writing on it, we can't understand it but it is different than the writing on the rock people's business card.
- Edie helped Elderwyn investigate the writing—it looks like it is saying, "this is not a place of honor" or something to that effect.
- The rock folks from earlier said they'd make it worth our while if we investigated this for them.
- Cascata goes straight in, finds a mining cart depot.
- I take some notes on the sharp metal coating the sides of the walls.
- Organic material is rotting on the carts.
- Airdreann investigates the sharp rocks that almost cut me, Elderwyn helped. The locals call it "wolfram" and describe it as a hungry metal. The group earlier encountered a ghost because of the metal. They had been mining the wolfram.
- We have headlamps and lanterns.
- We see a door hidden in the alcove—a foreman's office. Wooden door. We can see an office with a nice desk made of hewn stone. Logbooks, mugs, lantern with oil, and a map of the mine. On the map, the mine cart maps are shown; there are a bunch of veins drawn, but all but one are x'ed off. There is also writing on it that says "Do Not Dig Further". There is a two-shot derringer with one bullet but also missing a bullet, and when we look around the room we see blood. Looks like there was a fight.
- Airdreann reads the logbook—the dates don't make sense. Has some drawings—a wolf, a spider? We can decipher it as a downtime activity.
- We killed a little grenade guy and I shot it to death, but we all took 10 damage after it exploded.
- In the room, we find a locker with a shiny magical fireproof bag. The bag shield! When a skill lets you recover inventory points, you recover an additional inventory point.
- I made three potions and gave them to Vesper, Airdreann, and Elderwyn to heal them up.
- We got 5 XP for the session!
